I am a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science</a> of the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. My supervisors are <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/j-doyne-farmer/">Doyne Farmer</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ani.calinescu/">Ani Calinescu</a>. I am a member of <a href="https://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/">Wolfson College</a> and of the <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/research/programmes/complexity-economics">Complexity Economics Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a>. I am interested in game theory, networks, and (macroeconomic) agent-based modelling. I previously worked on fractals.

I was trained at the <a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/">University of Leipzig</a>, where I was a scholar of the <a href="https://www.sdw.org/">Foundation of German Business</a>, and hold a Diploma in Mathematics.

I am working part-time in the risk division (systematic and event-driven) of a <a href="https://www.bamfunds.com">hedge fund</a>, where I've been thinking about index rebal trades, maximum drawdown policies, and predicting extreme events.

I care about equity of education and taught basic mechanics and computer science at the <a href="https://www.inspirata.de">Inspirata</a>. We competed in the <a href="https://wro-association.org/home">World Robot Olympiad</a> twice. I like rowing, judo, and nice libraries. I don't like running.

Please reach me at samuel.wiese(at)cs.ox.ac.uk and find my CV <a href="/uploads/CV.pdf">here</a>.
